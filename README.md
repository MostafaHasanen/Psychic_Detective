# Psychic_Detective
Introducing architecture for detecting emotion. The sequential model was trained on images and voices of collected datasets provided by kaggle. The images were of the dimension 48x48 pixels. The training set consists of 28,700 face images and 27,200 voice. Using same Neural Network to get feeling of person with accuracy 95%
